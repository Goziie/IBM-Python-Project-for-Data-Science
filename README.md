# IBM-Python-Project-for-Data-Science
For this project, I am working for a new startup investment firm that helps customers invest their money in stocks. i extracted financial data like historical share price and quarterly revenue reportings from various sources using Python libraries and webscraping on popular stocks. After collecting this data I visualized it in a dashboard to identify patterns or trends. The stocks we will work with are Tesla, Amazon, AMD, and GameStop.
